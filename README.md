In this SQL project, using the transaction table, I've done an exploratary analysis using basic to moderate SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatsurana979/comprehensive-credit-card-transactions-dataset

I asked ChatGPT to give me questions by providing them with the fields as prompts, and proceeded to execute the query.

I used MS-SQL Server and imported the Excel files to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.
